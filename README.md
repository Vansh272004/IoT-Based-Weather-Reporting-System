# IoT-Based-Weather-Reporting-System
The IoT Weather Reporting System is designed to capture and monitor environmental conditions using a range of sensors. At the core of the system is the Arduino Nano ESP32 microcontroller, which serves as the main processing unit. This microcontroller reads data from sensors that monitor various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The collected data is processed and transmitted wirelessly, using the built-in Wi-Fi capability of the ESP32, to Arduino Cloud for real-time storage and analysis.

By leveraging Arduino Cloud, this system offers a convenient platform for users to access live weather data remotely. The data is visualized on customizable dashboards, making it easy to monitor environmental conditions from any internet-enabled device. Users can create alerts or automate certain actions based on specific weather conditions, further enhancing the functionality of the system.

The project demonstrates how IoT technology, combined with cloud services, can be used to create a robust and scalable weather monitoring solution. It showcases the seamless integration of hardware components, wireless communication, and cloud-based data management, making it ideal for both personal and industrial applications where real-time weather updates are crucial.
